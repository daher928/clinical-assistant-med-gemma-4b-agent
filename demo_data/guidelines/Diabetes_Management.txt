Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Management Guidelines

ADA Standards of Medical Care Summary

Glycemic Targets:
- HbA1c: <7% for most adults, <6.5% if achievable without hypoglycemia
- Individualize based on patient factors

First-Line Therapy:
1. Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise, weight loss)
2. Metformin (if eGFR >30)

Add-On Therapy Considerations:
- ASCVD or high CV risk: GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i with proven CV benefit
- Heart failure: SGLT2i with HF benefit
- CKD: SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA with kidney benefit

Monitoring:
- HbA1c: every 3 months if not at goal, every 6 months if stable
- Annual comprehensive foot exam
- Annual dilated eye exam
- Annual urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
- Annual lipid panel
- Blood pressure at every visit

Cardiovascular Risk Management:
- Statin therapy for most patients >40 years
- BP target <130/80 mmHg
- Aspirin for secondary prevention

Kidney Protection:
- ACE inhibitor or ARB for albuminuria
- SGLT2 inhibitor for CKD protection
- Avoid metformin if eGFR <30

Hypoglycemia Prevention:
- Regular monitoring
- Patient education
- Medication adjustment as needed

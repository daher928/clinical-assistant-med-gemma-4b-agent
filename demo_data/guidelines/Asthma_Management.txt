Asthma Management Guidelines

GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) Summary

Severity Classification:
- Intermittent: Symptoms <2 days/week
- Mild Persistent: Symptoms >2 days/week but not daily
- Moderate Persistent: Daily symptoms
- Severe Persistent: Continual symptoms, frequent exacerbations

Step-wise Treatment Approach:

Step 1 (Mild Intermittent):
- As-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA)
- Consider low-dose ICS-formoterol as needed

Step 2 (Mild Persistent):
- Daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)
- As-needed SABA

Step 3 (Moderate):
- Low-dose ICS + long-acting beta-agonist (LABA)
- OR medium-dose ICS alone

Step 4 (Moderate to Severe):
- Medium-dose ICS + LABA
- Consider adding leukotriene modifier (montelukast)

Step 5 (Severe):
- High-dose ICS + LABA
- Consider add-on therapy: tiotropium, biologics
- Refer to specialist

Monitoring:
- Assess control at each visit
- Peak flow monitoring
- Spirometry annually or as needed
- Medication technique review

Trigger Avoidance:
- Identify and avoid allergens
- Avoid NSAIDs in aspirin-sensitive asthma
- Smoking cessation

Exacerbation Management:
- Systemic corticosteroids
- Frequent SABA
- Consider oxygen if hypoxemic
- Hospital admission if severe

Action Plan:
- Written asthma action plan for all patients
- When to increase medications
- When to seek emergency care

Special Considerations:
- Aspirin-sensitive asthma: Avoid NSAIDs
- Exercise-induced: Pre-treat with SABA
- Pregnancy: Continue ICS, consider step-down after delivery
